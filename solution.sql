LEVEL 1
The organizers want to identify vulnerable living players who might be easily manipulated for the next game. Find all players who are alive, in severe debt (debt > 400,000,000 won), and are either elderly (age > 65) OR have a vice of Gambling with no family connections.

Show us how you handle our data, and remember â€“ in this game, there's no room for error.

/*
LEVEL 2
The organizers need to calculate how many food portions to withhold to create the right amount of tension. In a table, calculate how many rations would feed 90% of the remaining(alive) non-insider players (rounded down), and in another column, indicate if the current rations supply is sufficient. (True or False)
